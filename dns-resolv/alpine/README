1) Run two processes within container
2) Each process should listen on "dnsname" rather than hard-coded ip address
3) Pass necessary parameters to container ( eg: --network-alias for plain docker and --network name=,alias= for docker-swarm and etc)
4) Make sure, processes are able to bind to address


Here we rely on default DNS feature provided by docker daemon.
